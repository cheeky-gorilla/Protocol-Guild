Protocol Guild
------------

- A collective of Ethereum contributors 
- working to boost the incentives around stewarding the core protocol
- by maintaining an onchain registry of its membership
- which allows ecosystem sponsors to directly fund the membership, their work, the public good.

*"And, Ebling, there's another, greater purpose. Hari Seldon founded two Foundations three centuries ago; one at each end of the Galaxy. You must find that Second Foundation."* Foundation, Isaac Asimov

Sponsor the Pilot
================

We're running a 1 year pilot (`read more here <https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html>`_) to test our assumptions about the Protocol Guildâ€™s funding mechanism and how to operate it. 

Information about the smart contracts and how you can help fund public goods and their contributors can be found `here <https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html#xsplits-contracts>`_.

If you have additional questions about the project, please reach out to `@ProtocolGuild <https://twitter.com/ProtocolGuild>`_ or any of the `members <https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html>`_.
